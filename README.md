# DA - Project 1

## Brief Description

We were tasked with implementing an analysis tool that can support
the management team of a railway network to make informed decisions about how to best allocate its
resources, both financial and physical (e.g., trains). This tool, which will use a realistic data set, will
allow management to decide on aspects such as how to best assign selected trains to lines, how to maximize
its revenue when multiple levels of service are offered, or even, identify more sensitive sections of its
network to failures as to anticipate service disruption or at least to mitigate its nefarious effects.
